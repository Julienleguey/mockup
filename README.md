Project in 2 parts:
- server : to get the mockups and screenshots without CORS issue, very simple Express API
- client : html, css, and Vanilla JS

Start the project:

2. Open a console, go to the root of the project and then to /server. Run "npm install" to install the dependencies.
3. Run "npm start" to start the server.
4. On /client, just open index.html with your favorite web browser.

Only tested with Chrome. Can't tell for the other browsers.
